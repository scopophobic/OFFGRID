OFFGRID is a bleeding-edge browser-based frontend editor which prioritizes reducing unnecessary stress and inefficient workload on frontend developers using new-age AI solutions, so the developers could prioritize creativity and solving problems rather than solving bugs.


##  Problem  statement 
As a frontend developer, using traditional editors lack real-time feedback mechanisms, remote collaboration & being resource hogs. The cloud-based front-end development solutions in the market still lack new & efficient features, real-time AI-powered code suggestions and feedback, auto code reformatting, and auto-documentation. This results in longer development cycles focused away from creativity, reduced code quality, and a less efficient workflow.

## Our Unique Solutions
- RealTime Collaboration
- AI-Powered Debugging and Auto Suggestions
- Code refactoring, Auto Documentation
- Prompt Generative Dynamic UI Components
